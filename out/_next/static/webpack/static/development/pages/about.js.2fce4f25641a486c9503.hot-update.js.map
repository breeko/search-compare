For \n                    Google, search-compare uses the main google site (e.g. google.com/search?hl=en&q=search), but \n                    it doesn't pass any personally identifiable information.\n                </span>,\n            key: 3\n        },\n        {\n            question: <span>Why are DDG search results sometimes in Russian?</span>,\n            answer: <span>\n                        I don't know, as mentioned above, I get the results from the html version of DDG\n                        (e.g. duckduckgo.com/html/q=search). I tried to look for a way to specify the \n                        language or scrape the main site, but it  proved challenging.
